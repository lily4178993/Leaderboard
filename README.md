<!-- FAQ -->
## **FAQ ❓**<a name="faq"></a>


- **What is Webpack**

  - Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included.

- **Why should we use Webpack**

  - Webpack goes through your package and creates what it calls a dependency graph which consists of various modules which your webapp would require to function as expected. Then, depending on this graph, it creates a new package which consists of the very bare minimum number of files required, often just a single bundle.js file which can be plugged in to the html file easily and used for the application. It makes our code shorter, cleaner and compiles different javascript module.
